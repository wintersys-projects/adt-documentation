I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR, IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL THESE APPLICATIONS YOU NEED THE EXACT SAME STACKCRIPT CONFIGURATION AS FOR THE DEFAULT DEMO
BUT WITH THESE SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS FOR EACH APPLICATION TYPE/STYLE

### Demo 1 (Sample Wordpress Application)

This is just a sample wordpress template with some sample data installed which will show you how you can get a pre-built site up and running with this toolkit

1. Assuming that you have your valid credentials in your credentials file on your laptop (if you don't know what this is, go to the beginning of this document and start there) follow the steps in "POPULATE YOUR STACKSCRIPT" above.
2. Once the steps in POPULATE YOUR STACKCRIPT have been followed fully, make the following additional changes to the advanced settings of your Stackscript.
 
>     set "The Display name for your website e.g. My Demo Website" to "My Wordpress Demo"  
>     set "APPLICATION" to "wordpress"  
>     set "APPLICATION IDENTIFIER" to "2"  
>     set "BASELINE DB REPOSITORY" to "wordpressdemo-db-baseline" 
>     set "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "wordpressdemo-webroot-sourcecode-baseline"
