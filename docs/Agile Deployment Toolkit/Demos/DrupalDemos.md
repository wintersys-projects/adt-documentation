I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR, IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL THESE APPLICATIONS YOU NEED THE EXACT SAME STACKCRIPT CONFIGURATION AS FOR THE DEFAULT DEMO
BUT WITH THESE SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS FOR EACH APPLICATION TYPE/STYLE

### Demo 1 (Sample Drupal Based Opensocial Application)

[Opensocial](https://getopensocial.com)

1. Once the application is installed, the username is "webmaster" and the password is "mnbcxz098321QQQZZZ"  
 
>     set "The Display name for your website e.g. My Demo Website" to "My Opensocial Demo"  
>     set "APPLICATION" to "drupal"  
>     set "APPLICATION IDENTIFIER" to "3"  
>     set "BASELINE DB REPOSITORY" to "opensocial-db-baseline" (with sample data) or "opensocialvanilla-db-baseline" (without sample data)  
>     set "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "opensocial-webroot-sourcecode-baseline" (with sample data) or "opensocialvanilla-webroot-sourcecode-baseline" (without sample data)
