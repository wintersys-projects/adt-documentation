Perform step 1 or 2 below according to your experience and apply the overrides to your StackScript as described below for your desired demo type before you click "Create Linode"

1. If you are a beginner, follow [here](./QuickStartDemosPrepBeginnerLevel.md)  
2. If you are an expert, follow [here](./QuickStartDemosPrepExpertLevel.md)

### Demo 1 (StackScript overrides for a baselined Opensocial demo)

[Opensocial](https://getopensocial.com)

1. Once the application is installed, the username is "webmaster" and the password is "mnbcxz098321QQQZZZ"  
 
>     set "The Display name for your website e.g. My Demo Website" to "My Opensocial Demo"  
>     set "APPLICATION" to "drupal"  
>     set "BASELINE DB REPOSITORY" to "opensocial-db-baseline" (with sample data) or "opensocialvanilla-db-baseline" (without sample data)  
>     set "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "opensocial-webroot-sourcecode-baseline" (with sample data) or "opensocialvanilla-webroot-sourcecode-baseline" (without sample data)

NOTE: If you get any error messages from the Drupal CMS once it is installed you need to "clear all caches" which in my case I can do by going to this URL in my browser:
