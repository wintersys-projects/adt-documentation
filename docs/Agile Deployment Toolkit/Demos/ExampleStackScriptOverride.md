When I mention "Overriding" in reference to a StackScript, this is what I mean.

The supplied StackScript [stackscript]() has default values set for it. These defaults are set to make the demo application as simple to deploy as possible. When you want to deploy a different demo to the "default demo" you will certainly have to override some settings that have been supplied as default values in your StackScript. 

So, taking "Demo 1" [here](./JoomlaDemos.md) I can see that "Demo 1" invites us to override the following settings.
