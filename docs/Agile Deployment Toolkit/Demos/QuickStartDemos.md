## QUICK-START DEMOS 

INITIAL (PRE-REQUISITE) STEPS REQUIRED FOR ALL THE DEMOS LISTED BELOW

**NOTE:** These quick start demos are only intended for use on the Linode platform using the supplied [StackScript](https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts/635271) to demonstrate example usage cases for the Agile Deployment Toolkit as quickly and easily as possible.  The demos themselves are very quickly put together simply there for illustrative purposes they are not there to provide any truly useful function. If anyone would like to spend time crafting demos useful for real function that could be listed here that would be valued. 

The purpose of these quick start demos is to show you that with just some parameters you can achieve a lot using the Agile Deployment Toolkit with the possibility of going much deeper into it if you choose to.

For more information about parameter configuration please see the [spec](https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/main/templatedconfigurations/specification.md) and [quickspec](https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/main/templatedconfigurations/quick_specification.dat)

**PRE-REQUISITE STEPS MENTIONED IN THE DEMOS BELOW:**

Before you do anything, create a VPC in the gb-lon region called "adt-vpc" with a subnet of "10.0.1.0/24". The VPC create screen for my requirements looks like:

![](images/adt-vpc.png "ADT-VPC image")  

After following the 8 bullet points below, you should have a text file on your laptop with content similar to the following sample/example values:  

**Sample/example configuration parameters:**

Build Machine User: **"nuocial-deployer"**  
Build Machine Password: **"gdjkbcijbue2hhfdy3e8"**  
Build Machine SSH PORT: **"1035"**  
Laptop IP: **111.111.111.111**  
Linode account username : **linode-username**  
Linode account email address : **nuocialdeployer@gmail.com**  
Laptop public key : **ssh-rsa AAAAB3MbsHaC1Jc2EAA......8X8TGp19n root@penguin**  
Object Storage access key : **PJX1HOLT157FQ9WCQ52K**  
Object Storage secret key: **malXD6aIPRAlxR2zU3IrpDDFWbNSLoGKLA6T1JeP**  
Personal Access Token : **23c8b26866a9fd81634a83182da5e1193bcc73d731d9224732159a8e31989d29**  
Live Domain Name: **demo.nuocial.org.uk**  
Core Website Name: **nuocial**  
  
------------------------------------
To achieve the above please follow theses steps in turn. 

- Open up an empty text document on your laptop and make up a username, password and ssh port for your prospective build machine. Find the ip address of your laptop by going to [whats my ip](https://www.whatsmyip.com) and enter the ip address of your laptop into your empty text document, for example,   

>       "Username: nuocial-deployer"
>       "Password: gdjkbcijbue2hhfdy3e8"
>       "Port: 1035"
>       "Laptop IP: 111.111.111.111"  

- Setup an account with Linode [Linode](https://www.linode.com) - make a note in your text document that you opened in 1. of the username of your Linode account, for example,  
 
>        "Linode account username : nuocialdeployer"  

 and the email address you used to register your linode account under  for example,  

>        "Linode account email address : nuocialdeployer@gmail.com"

- Setup a pair of [SSH Keys](https://webdock.io/en/docs/webdock-control-panel/shell-users-and-sudo/set-up-an-ssh-key) on your laptop if you haven't already - make a note in your text document that you opened in 1 of the full public key part of the key pair you just generated for example,   

>        "Laptop public key : ssh-rsa AAAAB3MbsHaC1Jc2EAA......8X8TGp19n root@penguin"  

- Setup Object Storage for your account if its not already setup according to [Object Storage Setup](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/get-started/#generate-an-access-key) - make a note in your text document of the access key and the secret key for your object storage, for example,  

>        "Object Storage access key : PJX1HOLT157FQ9WCQ52K "  

and  

>        "Object Storage secret key: malXD6aIPRAlxR2zU3IrpDDFWbNSLoGKLA6T1JeP"  

- Generate a personal access token with all read and write permissions granted according to [Generate Personal Access Token](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/api/guides/manage-api-tokens/#create-an-api-token) - make a  note of your PAT in your text document for example,  

>        "Linode Personal Access Token : 23c8b26866a9fd81634a83182da5e1193bcc73d731d9224732159a8e31989d29"  

- Purchase a domain if you don't have one and change the nameservers of the domain to "**ns1.linode.com, ns2.linode.com, ns3.linode.com, ns4.linode.com and ns5.linode.com**" with your domain registrar (if you don't know how to purchase a domain and change its active nameservers, then, this toolkit probably isn't suitable for you). 

- You now need to make a note of the domain name you are using to deploy to, for example, if I have just purchased as set up a domain "**nuocial.org.uk**" in step 6, my intended domain name for my final website to be available at might be "**demo.nuocial.org.uk**" so make a note in your text file  

>        "Live Domain Name: demo.nuocial.org.uk"

You now need to update your linode DNS system with your new domain name. Click on "**Domains**" from the Linode GUI and add your domain name as a "**Primary Domain**" to the Linode DNS system in my case the primary domain will be "**nuocial.org.uk**"

- You need to make a note of the "core website name" which is "**nuocial**" if your domain name is "**demo.nuocial.org.uk**" and "testwebsite" if your domain name is "demo.testwebsite.uk"

>      "Core website name: nuocial"

-----------------------

You should now have a text file on your laptop that looks similar to my sample/example configuration parameters listed above. If you don't have all equivalent details to those listed your build most probably  won't succeed.   

What you now need to do to have your pre-requisite steps completed is enter the values that you have in your text file into the "**AgileDeploymentToolkitDemo**" Stackscript. To deploy the demo application, follow these steps

1. Go to "**Stackscripts**" from the GUI system of your Linode Account and find the public Stackscript "**AgileDeploymentToolkitDemo**" and click "**Deploy Linode**" 

2. You will then see a list of configurable text-fields that you are going to selectively enter the data from the text file you now have on your laptop. Each text-field has a label and so to configure the Stackscript, find the label as I mention it below and enter the corresponding value from your text file into that text-field

3. Label: **"SSH Public Key from your laptop (required)"** - value from YOUR text file which in my case is **"AAAAB3MbsHaC1Jc2EAA......8X8TGp19n root@penguin"**

4. Label: **"The username for your build machine user (required)"** - example value which in my case is **"nuocial-deployer"**

5. Label: **"The password for your build machine user (required)"** - example value which in my case is **"Hjdhufghks124$Â£"**

6. Label: **"The SSH port for your build machine (required)"** - example value which in my case is **"1035"**

7. Label: **"IP address of your laptop (required)"** - value from YOUR text file which in my case is **"111.111.111.111"**

8. Label: **"The username of your Linode account (required)"** - value from YOUR text file which in my case is **"linode-username"**

9. Label: **"The S3 access key for your linode object storage (required)"** - example value which in my case is **"PJX1HOLT157FQ9WCQ52K"**

10. Label: **"The S3 secret key for your linode object storage (required)"** - example value which in my case is 
**"malXD6aIPRAlxR2zU3IrpDDFWbNSLoGKLA6T1JeP"**

11. Label: **"Your linode personal access token (which must have all necessary rights granted) (required)"** - example value which in my case is **"23c8b26866a9fd81634a83182da5e1193bcc73d731d9224732159a8e31989d29"**

12.  Label: **"The email address of your DNS provider (required)"** - example value which in my case is the same email address as my linode account sign up email - **"nuocialdeployer@gmail.com"**

13.  Label: **"The access token for your DNS provider (required)"** - same as your PAT which in my case is **"23c8b26866a9fd81634a83182da5e1193bcc73d731d9224732159a8e31989d29"**

14. Label: **"The domain name of your website which must be registered with your DNS provide"** - example value which in my case is **"demo.nuocial.org.uk"**

15. Label: **"Website name if url is www.nuocial.org.uk this is nuocial (required)"** - example value which in my case is **"nuocial"**

---------------------------------------------------------------

For every demo below you need to run through all the pre-requisite steps mentioned above. For each demo, before you click "Create Linode" at the bottom of the page make sure that you are creating a linode in the correct region (gb-lon), that the Linode has a root password set. If you understand what you are doing, then the rest of the settings for your linode are left to your discretion.

Once you click "**Create Linode**", the build will deploy which will take some minutes. 

Once the build is completed:

You can ssh onto the build machine once it has started up with

>      ssh -p 1035 nuocial-deployer@<build-machine-ip>

then do a

>      sudo su <password as per step 4 above>
>      cd adt-build-machine-scripts
>      ./Logs.sh

**Note 1:**

Be aware that a new SSL certificate is issued each time you run this Stackscript which means that if you do multiple deployments you will run into "rate limiting" problems. If you need to perform multiple build cycles for a particular domain you are best off using the expedited method as described [here](<../Tutorials/linode/FOLLOW ME.md>). You can also set SSL_LIVE_CERT to 0 to use a staging certificate which doesn't have such restrictive rate limiting as a production certificate but it will likely give you a browser security warning when you access your website. 

**Note 2:**

Once your machines are built the firewall will be installed on your build machine (the machine that was built using the StackScript) but you can tighten what the firewall configuration provided by default by creating an additional firewall called "adt-build-machine" through your linode gui adding the build machine to it and creating a rule to only allow access from your "LAPTOP IP" mentioned above to the "Build Machine SSH PORT" mentioned above. This will tighten up the security of your build machine to only allow SSH access from your laptop and to the specific port you have configured SSH to use through your selection. All the other ports on your build machine will be firewalled off making it more difficult to compromise because it has sensitive access keys and secret keys on it. This will give you two layers of tightly configured fire walling for your build machine the native firewall which you optionally set up manually as just described and the ufw/iptables firewalling that is set up automatically. 

**Note 3:**

These are only demos and use naked DNS configurations (meaning no proxying through a service to facilitate a WAF and so on). If you want to get more serious you very likely will want to configure Cloudflare or run one of our [authentication server](../Operations/AuthenticationServer.md) setups that provide a solution for zero trust access to your webproperty. You can also modify the toolkit to use a different WAF provider to Cloudflare if you choose because there are other options. 

**Note 4:**

Once the build has completed you might have to give the Linode DNS system a few minutes to refresh with the IP address that has been added for this build. 

**Note 5:** 

If you are using the Linode DNS system which you are by default then you will might need to clear your broswer's DNS cache between deployments for the website to display. In Chrome you can do this by going to "**chrome://net-internals/#dns**"

**Note 6:**

In all these examples don't forget to attach the build machine you are provisioning to the adt-vpc that you created above remembering to "**Assign a public IPv4 address for this Linode**".

-----------------------

### Demo 10 (Virgin Drupal install)  

1. Follow the all the pre-requisite at the top of this page 
2. Once the pre-requisite steps are all followed, also alter the following settings in your Stackscript:   

>     "The number (1, 2 or 3) of the template you are using" to "1"  
>     "The Display name for your website e.g. My Demo Website" to "My Drupal Demo" 
>     "APPLICATION" to "drupal"   
>     "APPLICATION IDENTIFIER" to "3"  
>     "DRUPAL VERSION" set it to the latest version of drupal for example, "10.0.10" 
>     "BUILD CHOICE" to "0"  
>     "BUILD ARCHIVE CHOICE" to "virgin"   
>     "BASELINE DB REPOSITORY" to "VIRGIN"  
>     "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "DRUPAL:10.0.10"   

You can then deploy your Linode using your Stackscript and wait for your Drupal install will come online  

You will see a message asking you to remove _J* file from the installation folder. Once you see this message wait until your system clock on your laptop cycles to the next minute and the system will have deleted it for you. You can then scroll down and click "Install Joomla" 

**Note:**   

You can install a vanilla copy of [OpenSocial](https://www.getopensocial.com/) instead of a version of Drupal by making the following adjustments to the 8 steps outlined above for demo 10 

>     "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "DRUPAL:social" 

**IMPORTANT**   

and at the time of writing, PHP8.1 is the supported version for opensocial so you need to also set  
>     "PHP VERSION" to "8.1"

Change the value 
>     "The Display name for your website e.g. My Demo Website" to "My Opensocial Demo"  
>     "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "DRUPAL:social"  

>     root@localhost:/home/agile-deployer/adt-build-machine-scripts# ./Log.sh
>     Which cloudhost do you want to view logs for DigitalOcean (do), Exoscale (exo), Linode (lin) or Vultr (vul)
>     Please type one of do, exo, lin, vul
>     lin
>     What is the build identifier you want to connect to?
>     You have these builds to choose from: 
>     testbuild
>     Please enter the name of the build of the server you wish to connect with
>     testbuild
>     tail (t) or cat (c) or vim (v)
>     c
>     Do you want out (1) or err (2) or stat (3)
>     1
>     OK, I'll be kind and show you one time your drupal database credentials.

### Demo 12 (Sample Virgin Joomla Install from a Baseline Repository)

This is just a sample joomla install there's no sample data or anything it just shows you how you could baseline a virgin joomla installation for maximum ease when making repeated virgin CMS deployments. You can do the same thing for Wordpress, Drupal or Moodle if you chose to. The advantage to creating a baseline of a virgin installation of a CMS is that you don't have to enter any parameters into the application GUI because the system deals with it all for you and so you can make faster deployments once you have a baseline to build from. The disadvantage is that you have to update the installed CMS from the administrator backend to the latest version because the baseline you made some weeks/months ago will be several releases back from current.

1. Follow the all the pre-requisite at the top of this page 
2. Once the pre-requisite steps are all followed, also alter the following settings in your Stackscript: 

>     "The number (1, 2 or 3) of the template you are using" to "2"  
>     "The Display name for your website e.g. My Demo Website" to "My Vanilla Joomla Installation"  
>     "APPLICATION" to "joomla"  
>     "APPLICATION IDENTIFIER" to "1"  
>     "BASELINE DB REPOSITORY" to "joomla5.2.5-db-baseline" 
>     "APPLICATION BASELINE SOURCECODE REPOSITORY" to "joomla5.2.5-webroot-sourcecode-baseline"

Wait for the application install to have been completed and available at:
