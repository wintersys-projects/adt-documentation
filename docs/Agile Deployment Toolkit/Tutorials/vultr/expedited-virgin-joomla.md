**EXPEDITED VIRGIN DEPLOYMENT METHOD**

PREBUILD NECESSITIES  

If you don't already have a build machine running in the Exoscale cloud, follow these steps to get ready for the main build)

1. Begin by following this: [Build Machine Setup](./buildmachine.md)

Following the steps in 1. will give you a build machine with access through the firewall for one machine (the laptop IP address that you provided).

-----------------------------

EXPEDITED BUILD PROCESS

This will deploy the latest version of Joomla using template 1 which you can read about here: [template 1](https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/main/templatedconfigurations/templates/vultr/vultr1.description) and the expedited method.

If you have followed these steps your build machine is online and secured and you have an SSH session open to it from your laptop through which to initiate your build processes.

We need several pieces of information from our cloud host and 3rd party services for a successful build to be possible:

I am going to use the example of joomla to build from and so this example will build a virgin installation of the latest version of joomla

---------------------------------------

To find the latest version of Joomla, I go to this URL in my browser:

[Joomla Latest](https://downloads.joomla.org/)

And I note the latest version in a separate text file:

>     joomla_version="5.3.0"  

You can of course use a legacy version of joomla also by choosing a different version numnber. 

-------------------------------------

In production use you should use the principle of least privileges to generate 2 different access tokens, one token for compute and one token for DNS scope, but, to make this tutorial simple we can just generate one token with permissions for both scope sets. 

Create a personal access token as follows:

![](images/expedited/vultr13.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 13")
![](images/expedited/vultr14.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 14")


Now record your token in your separate text file on your laptop

>     vultr_access_token="AEWBXAWCFMMKESEHGSHGSHJD42JXD6HXECJT7XXA....."  

-----------------------------------

Now you need to generate an access key and a secret key for Vultr Object Storage which is the S3 compatible object storage offering from Vultr
How to generate your access key and your secret key is shown in the following images:

![](images/expedited/vultr15.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 15")
![](images/expedited/vultr16.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 16")
![](images/expedited/vultr25.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 25")
![](images/expedited/vultr26.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 26")



Now record your vultr object storage secret key and your vultr object storage access key in the text file on your laptop

>     vultrobjectstorage_access_key="B0ICCHUR3M8C1JXXC6CA"
>     vultrobjectstorage_secret_key="kjdin34ngfjne....."


--------------------------

You now need to make a note of the email address that you login to your vultr account with:

>     vultr_email="petervultr@yahoo.com"

-----------------------------------

You then need the url that you want to use for your website. If you don't have a DNS URL for your website, you need to purchase one and set the nameservers to vultr as described [here](../../Deployment/Nameservers.md)

>     vultr_dns_name="www.drpatient.uk"

![](images/expedited/vultr23.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 23")
![](images/expedited/vultr24.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 24")

--------------------------------

You then need to get an access key for your personal github account (you are advised to have a new separate github account for use with this toolkit)

[Setting up a github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)  

[Setting up personal access tokens for github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)  

(your personal access token must have enough privileges to create repositories which means the "administrator" and "contents" options need to be set to read/write. Only setting these two values follows the principle of least privileges) 

![](images/expedited/vultr56.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 56")
![](images/expedited/vultr57.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 57")

>     vultr_github_username="adt-apps" #MANDATORY
>     vultr_github_key="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k4" #MANDATORY

So, that should be all the core credentials that I need to make a deployment. I can save my text file now (and keep it secure) because I might want to use these credentials again for other deployments or redeployments.  

--------------------------------------------

So, at the command line of my build machine that we spun up earlier:

My chosen username is "wintersys-projects"

So, to begin an expedited build process, I need to:

>     cd /home/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/vultr

Then we can open up the 

>     vi vultr1.tmpl

I then update all fields marked "MANDATORY" (marked in red) referring to the values that I have stored in the text file in my laptop in the correct template and when I am finished it looks like:

If your template looks similar to the one I have provided here with all the fields marked in red having your custom values then you should be ready for deployment

>     ${BUILD_HOME}/ExpeditedAgileDeploymentToolkit.sh

Note: because I haven't asked you to set up system emailing (to keep this tutorial as simple as possible) you will see these below messages during the deployment but you can safely ignore them it just means that there won't be any system emails sent for this deployment iteration.

IGNORE THESE IF YOU SEE THEM
>     Your value for the variable SYSTEM_EMAIL_PROVIDER () doesn't appear to be valid please review
>     It looks to me like the email address for the variable SYSTEM_TOEMAIL_ADDRESS () doesn't appear to be valid please review
>     It looks to me like the email address for the variable SYSTEM_FROMEMAIL_ADDRESS () doesn't appear to be valid please review

You will then need to answer the questions that you are asked and in a few minutes you should be able to install joomla using the GUI system of your browser. Please note, the credentials,port,database IP that you need to enter into the joomla GUI will be shown at the end of the build process.

When I ran the build process when writing this tutorial it looked as follows:

<span style="color:red">NOTE: In this image or this part of the output you will find the credentials you must set for your joomla application</span>

<span style="color:red">NOTE: To display the joomla application you must go to your website URL in your browser such as https://www.drpatient.uk/installation/index.php</span>   

![](images/expedited/vultr33.png "Vultr Tutorial Image 33")

Assuming that you have your Joomla application online that's this tutorial through.   

What I would do if I wanted to build a Wordpress, Moodle or Drupal installation would be to follow the same procedure with the same template, but, minimally change the template as follows:

**For Wordpress:**

>     export APPLICATION="wordpress"
>     export APPLICATION_BASELINE_SOURCECODE_REPOSITORY="WORDPRESS" #MANDATORY 

**For Drupal:**

>     export APPLICATION="drupal"
>     export DRUPAL_VERSION="11.0.1" 
>     export APPLICATION_BASELINE_SOURCECODE_REPOSITORY="DRUPAL:11.0.1" #MANDATORY 

**For Moodle:**  

>     export APPLICATION="moodle"
>     export APPLICATION_BASELINE_SOURCECODE_REPOSITORY="MOODLE" #MANDATORY
