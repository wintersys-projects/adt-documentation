**GENERATING A USERDATA SCRIPT FOR THE HARDCORE DEPLOYMENY BUILD STYLE**

BE AWARE THAT WHEN MAKING A HARDCORE STYLE DEPLOYMENT WITH SSL_LIVE_CERT="1" A NEW SSL CERTIFICATE IS PROVISIONED FOR EACH DEPLOYMENT AND YOU WILL RAPIDLY REACH ISSUANCE LIMITS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENTS WITH (FOR EXAMPLE, LETSENCRYPT) WHICH WILL CAUSE THE DEPLOYMENT TO FAIL

To get a "hardcore" userdata script that you can use for multiple deployments what you need will need a fully configured template that the user data script can be built from. To have a fully configured template, you can follow the appropriate tutorial below depending on whether you want your userdata script to deploy a virgin CMS, a baselined application or a deployment based on a temporal backup in your datastore.

[Virgin CMS Installation](./expedited-virgin-joomla.md)   
[Baseline CMS Installation](./expedited-baseline-joomla.md)  
[Temporal CMS Installation](./expedited-temporal-joomla.md)

Once you have made a deployment using one of these tutorials then you can be confident that the template associated with the deployment is valid and knowing that you have a valid template you can go ahead and create a hardcore build userdata script. 

Virgin class builds are associated with template1 (vultr1.tmpl), baseline builds are associated with template 2 (vultr2.tmpl) and temporal builds are associated with template 3 (vultr3.tmpl)

In this example, we will use template 1 assuming that we have followed the Vigin CMS installation tutorial.  

>     /bin/mkdir ${BUILD_HOME}/adt-build-machine-scripts/overridescripts/
>     /bin/cp ${BUILD_HOME}/adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/exoscale/vultr1.tmpl ${BUILD_HOME}/adt-build-machine-scripts/overridescripts/vultr1override.tmpl  

Then you need to run the script:

>     cd helperscripts

>     ./GenerateHardcoreUserDataScript.sh

This will leave you with a script:

>     ${BUILD_HOME}/userdatascripts/${userdatascript}   

where ${userdatascript} is the descriptive name you gave when prompted.  

Have a look at the userdata script 

>     vi ${BUILD_HOME}/userdatascripts/${userdatascript} 

Now, substitute this userdata script that you have generated instead of the default initial script when you follow  [Build Machine Setup](./buildmachine.md). When you use your userdata script instead of the default init script, the build will proceed automatically with no need for interaction from you. Once you have a user data script you can use it for repeated deployments tweaky it as necessary for each deployment cycle.
