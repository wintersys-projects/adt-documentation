You now need to copy your template as follows:  

>     /bin/mkdir ./adt-build-machine-scripts/overridescripts/
>     /bin/cp ./adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/exoscale/exoscale1.tmpl ./adt-build-machine-scripts/overridescripts/exoscale1override.tmpl  

Then you need to run the script:

>     cd helperscripts

>     ./GenerateHardcoreUserDataScript.sh

This will leave you with a script:

>    ../userdatascripts/${userdatascript}   

where ${userdatascript} is the descriptive name you gave when prompted.  

It is mandatory to edit your userdata script and modify these values within it to your liking:

>     export BUILDMACHINE_USER="agile-user"
>     export BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD="Hjdhfb34hdÂ£" #Make sure any password you choose is strong enough to pass any strength enforcement rules of your OS
>     export BUILDMACHINE_SSH_PORT="1035"
>     export LAPTOP_IP="111.111.111.111"

>     export SSH=\"\" #paste your public key here
>     export SELECTED_TEMPLATE="1"


------------------------------------------

Now you have your userdata script take a copy of the entirity of it using copy and paste and then follow [these](./buildmachine-hardcore.md) instructions PASTING THE SCRIPT YOU HAVE JUST COPIED INTO THE USERDATA AREA OF YOUR EXOSCALE MACHINE INSTEAD OF THE MODIFIED TEMPLATE. The build machine will then install **AND**  run the agile deployment toolkit. This is just an alternative method to the expedited build process which you may or may not perfer.


At this point, your build machine should be up and running.
