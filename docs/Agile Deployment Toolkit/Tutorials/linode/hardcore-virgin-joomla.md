#### IT IS A BIT MORE EFFORT TO GET A HARDCORE BUILD COMPLETED, BUT, ONCE IT IS DONE YOU WILL HAVE A STACKSCRIPT WHICH YOU CAN CONFIGURE DIRECTLY AND REPEATEDLY FOR YOUR USES
----------------------  

**HARDCORE BUILD PROCESS**

1. On your laptop perform the following command:  

>     git clone https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts.git

We need several pieces of information from our cloud host and 3rd party services for a successful build to be possible:

I am going to use the example of joomla to build from and so this example will build a virgin installation of the latest version of joomla

This tutorial will deploy the latest version of Joomla using template 1 which you can read about here with the clone you have just made onto your laptop:  

>     ./adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/linode/linode1.description and the hardcore method.

---------------------------------------

**Record and save the credentials you are about to create in a secure file on your laptop**

To find the latest version of Joomla, I go to this URL in my browser:

[Joomla Latest](https://downloads.joomla.org/)

And I note the latest version in a separate text file:

>     joomla_version="4.0.4"  

You can of course use a legacy version of joomla also by choosing a different version numnber. 

-------------------------------------

> I then need a personal access token for Linode, I go to the top right and select "API Keys" and generate a personal access token with 

> "Account,Domains, Images, IPs, Linodes, Object Storage, Stackscripts and Volumes" 

> scope enabled. This personal access token I shall call "AAAAA"

**IMPORTANT EDIT: To use the native firewalling system the linode-cli tool seems to only accept personal access tokens with full access rights, so, whilst that is the case, you will need to ignore the above scoping and just chose "Select All" with "Read and Write" access when you create your personal access token.** 

>     linode_personal_access_token="AAAAA"  where AAAAA is the actual values generated when I click "Create Token"

-------------------------

You now need to set up Object Storage and obtain Object Storage Keys. You can do this by Selecting Object Storage on the left hand side of your Linode console. 

You then click "Access Key" and then, "Create Access Key" and this will display an "Access Key" and a "Secret Key" which you need to make a note of and keep safe:

>     linode_S3_access_key="BBBBB"
>     linode_S3_secret_key="CCCCC"

-----------------------------------

You now need to make a note of the email address that you have registered with your linode account:

>     linode_email="testemail@testemail.com"

-----------------------------------

You then need the url that you want to use for your website. If you don't have a DNS URL for your website, you need to purchase one and set the nameservers to linode as described in ./adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/master/doco/AgileToolkitDeployment/Nameservers.md

>     linode_dns_name="www.testdeploy.com"

-------------------------------

You then need the username and owner of you git provider application repositories.  

To do this, if you don't have a git account sign up with one (in this case using github, but, you have the choice of bitbucket and gitlab as well) and record the username that you sign up with:

>     gitusername="yourgithubuser"

Then create a "personal access token" by following: 

[Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) making sure you give it all "repo" permissions as well as the "delete repository" permission

>     gitpersonalaccesstoken="KKKKK" where KKKKK represents your actual personal access token

--------------------------------

To keep this as simple as possible, I have missed out the SMTP credentials, but, you can find out more about them  

[Deploying SMTP Service](../../../doco/AgileToolkitDeployment/DeployingSMTPService.md)  

If you wish to include SMTP credentials you will need to have a service offering set up with either sendpulse, mailjet or AWS SES.

--------------------------

**NOTE:** 
**The CLOUDHOST_PASSWORD value must be set in your template for a linode based build to succeed.** 

--------------------------

So, that should be all the core credentials that I need to make a deployment. I can save my text file now (and keep it secure) because I might want to use these credentials again for other deployments or redeployments. 

--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

So, to begin an hardcore build process, I need to:

>     vi ./adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/linode/linode1.tmpl

This file looks like this (I have put a dashes before each line I wish to modify for this deployment which is for illustrative purposes only):

So, editing

and using the values I recorded in my text file earlier, I modify the file as follows, the lines beginning with dashes have been modified

If all the dashes I have added are removed, then this file (with live values and not symbolic ones) would be ready for deployment.  

You now need to copy your template as follows:  

>     /bin/mkdir ./adt-build-machine-scripts/overridescripts/
>     /bin/cp ./adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/linode/linode1.tmpl ./adt-build-machine-scripts/overridescripts/linode1override.tmpl  

Then you need to run the script:

>     cd helperscripts

>     ./GenerateOverrideTemplate.sh  (make sure you review and set all **ALL** of the settings - reviewing them generates the stackscript)  

**ESSENTIAL NOTE: with the GenerateOverrideTemplate script above, you need to review every setting for the stack script to be generated**

With Linode you can either use a StackScript or userdata (limited regional and OS availability currently) to spin up your machines. In both cases you need to generate a different script. You can either generate a stack script to use or you can use the Metadata service (which is industry standard)

**Stackscript**

>     ./GenerateHardcoreUserDataScript.sh stack

This will leave you with a script:

>    ../userdatascripts/${userdatascript}   

where ${userdatascript} is the descriptive name you gave when prompted.  

This is a Stack Script - if you don't understand Stack Scripts you can read:  

[Stack Script Tutorial](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/writing-scripts-for-use-with-linode-stackscripts-a-tutorial/).  

**You need to:**  

1. take a copy of the userdata script (the whole thing) by copying it and pasting it to create a Stack Script out of it. 
2. You then need to populate the main variables and modify (if you need to, the advanced ones) of the Stack Script as you ususally would. 
3. You then need to create a linode from your Stack Script.

If you don't want to use a stackscript and want to use the metadata service instead, 

 **Metadata Service**

>     ./GenerateHardcoreUserDataScript.sh stack


This will leave you with a script:

>    ../userdatascripts/${userdatascript}   

where ${userdatascript} is the descriptive name you gave when prompted.  

You will need to enter values to suit your deployment into the userdatascript for:

>     export BUILDMACHINE_USER="agile-user"
>     export BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD="Hjdhfb34hd£" #Make sure any password you choose is strong enough to pass any strength enforcement rules of your OS
>     export BUILDMACHINE_SSH_PORT="1035"
>     export LAPTOP_IP="111.111.111.111"

>     export SSH=\"\" #paste your public key here
>     export SELECTED_TEMPLATE="1"

This will give you a script which you can post into the userdata script of a linode - the linode that you are deploying as your new build machine. So basically configure a vanilla linode and paste the userdata script into the userdata or metadata service area of the linode to spin up your the build machine for your deployment.

At this point, you can deploy your build machine should be up and running in short order. Please then review 
  
[Tighten Build Machine](../../../doco/AgileToolkitDeployment/TightenBuildMachineAccess.md) 
 
At this point, your build machine will only accept connections from your laptop. If you need access from other ip addresses you need to use the technique described in "Tightening Build Machine Access" to grant access to additional IP addresses. This will be the case every time your laptop changes its IP address as you travel about, so, you might want to setup and configure an S3 client on your laptop to enable you to grant access to new IP addresses easily.
