**EXPEDITED VIRGIN DEPLOYMENT METHOD** 

PREBUILD NECESSITIES

If you don't already have a build machine running in the Linode cloud, follow these steps to get ready for the main build)

1. Begin by following this: [Build Machine Setup](./build-machine.md)

Following the steps in 1. will give you a build machine with access through the firewall for one machine (the laptop IP address that you provided).

-----------------------------

EXPEDITED BUILD PROCESS

This will deploy the latest version of Joomla using template 1 which you can read about here: [template 1](https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/main/templatedconfigurations/templates/linode/linode1.description) and the expedited method.

If you have followed these steps your build machine is online and secured and you have an SSH session open to it from your laptop through which to initiate your build processes.

We need several pieces of information from our cloud host and 3rd party services for a successful build to be possible:

I am going to use the example of joomla to build from and so this example will build a virgin installation of the latest version of joomla

---------------------------------------

To find the latest version of Joomla, I go to this URL in my browser:

[Joomla Latest](https://downloads.joomla.org/)

And I note the latest version in a separate text file:

>     joomla_version="5.3.0"  

You can of course use a legacy version of joomla also by choosing a different version numnber. 

-------------------------------------

In production use you should use the principle of least privileges and have one key for DNS and one key for compute but here we will generate a single personal access token with ability to manipulate DNS records as well as compute and use the same key for both but in production you should have one PAT that just has DNS scope and one key which has scope for all your other needs.

![](images/expedited/lin29.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 29")
![](images/expedited/lin30.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 30")


Now record your access key and secret key in your separate text file on your laptop

>     linode_personal_access_token="20c698ca4f7e0338c4c886bc7bc8e6d86f6f2148b05c"

--------------------------------

We now need to set up a key pair for Object Storage

![](images/expedited/lin31.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 31")  

Create a scratch bucket in order to active Object Storage if Object Storage  is not already active on your account  

![](images/expedited/lin33.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 33")
![](images/expedited/lin34.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 34")
![](images/expedited/lin35.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 35")
Create access keys with **UNLIMITED** access to your current region (gb-lon)  
![](images/expedited/lin36.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 36")
![](images/expedited/lin37.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 37")


Now record your Object Storage access keys in the text file on your laptop:

>     linode_object_storage_access_key="D0USS8R23RBK70TK"
>     linode_object_storage_secret_key="TqdUIUd3NuYSVd2MiZCFfPzXPXnoS"

-----------------------------------

You now need to make a note of the email address that you login to your exoscale account with:

>     linode_email="peterlinode@yahoo.com"

-----------------------------------

You then need the url that you want to use for your website. If you don't have a DNS URL for your website, you need to purchase one and set the nameservers to exoscale as described [here](../../Deployment/Nameservers.md)

>     linode_dns_name="www.drpatient.uk"

--------------------------------

You then need to get an access key for your personal github account (you are advised to have a new separate github account for use with this toolkit)

[Setting up a github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)  

[Setting up personal access tokens for github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)  

(your personal access token must have enough privileges to create repositories which means the "administrator" and "contents" options need to be set to read/write. Only setting these two values follows the principle of least privileges)

>     linode_github_username="adt-apps" #MANDATORY
>     linode_github_key="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k4" #MANDATORY

So, that should be all the core credentials that I need to make a deployment. I can save my text file now (and keep it secure) because I might want to use these credentials again for other deployments or redeployments.  

--------------------------------------------

So, at the command line of my build machine that we spun up earlier:

My chosen username is "wintersys-projects"

So, to begin an expedited build process, I need to:

>     cd /home/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/templatedconfigurations/templates/linode

Then we can open up the 

>     vi linode1.tmpl

I then update all fields marked "MANDATORY" (marked in red) referring to the values that I have stored in the text file in my laptop in the correct template and when I am finished it looks like:

If your template looks similar to the one I have provided here with all the fields marked in red having your custom values then you should be ready for deployment

>     ${BUILD_HOME}/ExpeditedAgileDeploymentToolkit.sh

Note: because I haven't asked you to set up system emailing (to keep this tutorial as simple as possible) you will see these below messages during the deployment but you can safely ignore them it just means that there won't be any system emails sent for this deployment iteration.

IGNORE THESE IF YOU SEE THEM
>     Your value for the variable SYSTEM_EMAIL_PROVIDER () doesn't appear to be valid please review
>     It looks to me like the email address for the variable SYSTEM_TOEMAIL_ADDRESS () doesn't appear to be valid please review
>     It looks to me like the email address for the variable SYSTEM_FROMEMAIL_ADDRESS () doesn't appear to be valid please review

You will then need to answer the questions that you are asked and in a few minutes you should be able to install joomla using the GUI system of your browser. Please note, the credentials,port,database IP that you need to enter into the joomla GUI will be shown at the end of the build process.

When I ran the build process when writing this tutorial it looked as follows:

![](images/expedited/lin42.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 42")
![](images/expedited/lin43.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 43")
![](images/expedited/lin44.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 44")
![](images/expedited/lin45.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 45")
![](images/expedited/lin46.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 46")

<span style="color:red">NOTE: In this image or this part of the output you will find the credentials you must set for your joomla application</span>   


![](images/expedited/lin47.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 47")
![](images/expedited/lin48.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 48")


<span style="color:red">NOTE: To display the joomla application you must go to your website URL in your browser such as https://www.topdog-insiders.uk/installation/index.php</span>   

![](images/expedited/lin49.png "Exoscale Tutorial Image 49")

Assuming that you have your Joomla application online that's this tutorial through.   

What I would do if I wanted to build a Wordpress, Moodle or Drupal installation would be to follow the same procedure with the same template, but, minimally change the template as follows:

**For Wordpress:**

>     export APPLICATION="wordpress"
>     export APPLICATION_BASELINE_SOURCECODE_REPOSITORY="WORDPRESS" #MANDATORY 
>     export APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER="2"

**For Drupal:**

>     export APPLICATION="drupal"
>     export DRUPAL_VERSION="11.0.1" 
>     export APPLICATION_BASELINE_SOURCECODE_REPOSITORY="DRUPAL:11.0.1" #MANDATORY 
>     export APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER="3"

**For Moodle:**

>     export APPLICATION="moodle"
>     export APPLICATION_BASELINE_SOURCECODE_REPOSITORY="MOODLE" #MANDATORY 
>     export APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER="4"

So, you have a template now that you can use over and over again for deploying different installations of these CMS systems. You can study the spec and learn how to modify the template in order to change machine sizes, regions, PHP settings and so on.
