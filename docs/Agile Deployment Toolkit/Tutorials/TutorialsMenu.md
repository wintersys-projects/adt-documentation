It is recommended that you always have a separate account for your ADT deployments. In other words, if you have a Digital Ocean account for other projects that you set up a second encapsulated Digital Ocean account for use with the ADT so that you don't get the Digital Ocean Spaces that the toolkit will generate entangled and therefore confused with DigitalOcean spaces that you have for other application and likewise with droplets that you have active for other applications in a region you don't want your ADT droplets entangled with droplets for other applications or projects. The same thing is true for all the providers I suport, Linode, Exoscale or Vultr.
