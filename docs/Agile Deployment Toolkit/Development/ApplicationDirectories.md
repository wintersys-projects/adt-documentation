Application directories are envisioned to be whole applications that have been built (by expert application developers) to meet a particular business need and then the whole application is installed ready for use "off the shelf" by a customer using this toolkit. For example, if you bought a solution like Hivebrite it would be a complete application already and you wouldn't need to do anything to use the application but the idea here is to have preconfigured applications of all different types that can be built on top of CMS systems and installed using this toolkit. VERY simple example applications (built in minutes) are shown in the "Quick Start Demos" referenced above. Ultimately I realised that limitations of solutions like Hivebrite is that the application developer is the only one with control over its feature set meaning that if a customer wants some feature that is not supported they have to appeal to the developers for their feature request to be included which they may or may not honour. With an objective like I have with a DMS system, an application developer can still build the base feature set of the application which the customer can buy "off the shelf", but, the customer can tweak the work that the base application developer has put in so that it meets the customers precise requirements. So with this solution you are free to make use of reusable base applications but you are also free to customise the base applications as well and for me this is an important win over solutions where you have to appeal to their developers for any customisations that you want. A CMS component vendor, then, could provide complete and configured applications using their extensions and components which (people like me who don't know their software intricately) can then use as their community solutions safe in the knowledge that it is optimised and confgured by the experts.
