**APPLICATION DIRECTORIES**

Application directories are envisioned to be whole applications that have been built (by expert application developers) to meet a particular business need using a CMS system. The whole application is then installed ready for use "off the shelf" by a customer using this toolkit. For example, if you bought a solution like Hivebrite it would be a complete application already and you wouldn't need to do anything to use the application. The idea here is to do something similar and have complete preconfigured applications of all different types, e-commerce applications, social networks, prebuilt blogging solutions and so on that can be built on top of CMS systems. VERY simple example applications (built in minutes) are shown in the "Quick Start Demos". Ultimately I realised that limitations of solutions like Hivebrite is that the application developer is the only one with control over its feature set meaning that if a customer wants some feature that is not supported they have to appeal to the developers for their feature request to be included which they may or may not honour. With an objective like I have with this DMS system an application developer can still build the base feature set of the application which the customer can buy "off the shelf" as mostly complete for that customer's needs, but, the customer can also tweak the work that the base application developer has put in so that it meets the customer's precise requirements. So with this solution you are free to make use of reusable base applications but you are also free to customise the base applications as well and for me this is an important win over solutions where you have to appeal to their developers for any customisations that you want. A CMS component vendor, then, could provide complete and configured applications using their extensions and components which (people like me who don't know their software intricately) can then use as the base of their community solutions safe in the knowledge that it is optimised and configured by the experts.

A DMS like this one does require learning just like a CMS does but would you want to go back to coding in basic HTML once you have discovered CMS systems, possibly not. If its money that you are interested in, application developers using this toolkit should be able to produce high quality COTS (Commerical Off The Shelf) web applications using their CMS of choice and have the applications they have deveoped reused by many customers making strides in all round productivity in the process. Think about the current model. If I want to build a "Community Builder" social network using Joomla I have to start from scratch wondering "what does this do", "how does that work" and so does the "other guy" doing something very similar to me. If I can instead use a preconfigured application solution, complete with online quality reviews from other customers, provided by the developers of Community Builder or another Community Builder expert from an applications directory or library and the "other guy" can do the same and so on then that satisifies a basic software engineering requirement of "write once, use many times" and it's that "write once use many times" principle which is at the heart of the win I am trying to achieve here.
