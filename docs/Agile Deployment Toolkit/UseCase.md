**An example use-case for the ADT**

I designed my tooling with a particular type of use case in mind. 

Say your town has 4 or 5 libraries in it. Maybe you might like to have a fully accessible (as in specifically designed for use by people with disabilities such as sight loss), multi-lingual ready, moderated, validated identity social network for each library and its catchment area. 

The way I would commission a project like that is that I would

- Work out what the applications function is to be and what specific requirements I have of it for maximum usage and impact within the catchment area of that library. -
- Decide what CMS system I want to use to build the solution (lets say we choose Joomla because accessibility is very important to us). 
- Commission Joomla experts (who are for the most part volunteers like me so it shouldn't cost a whole heap of devil coin) to build the core application in a "write once use many times" ethos or if you prefer, "develop once deploy many times" ethos. 
- Once you are happy with the function of your commissioned application deploy it to each of the libraries using the agile deployment toolkit.
- Once the application is live make it known to the public and to join their local library centred social network, they need to provide proof of ID and proof of address (to show that they are within the catchment area of the specific library) at their library at which point an account is set up for them by library staff with an immutable login and email which they are then responsible for all behaviours of that account. 

And so that would be just one example usecase that I had a vision for the ADT and there's possibly a lot of other use cases wherever there is a "develop once deploy multiple times" need. 

As another example of how you might make to make use of my  work...if you are a charity with a presence in multiple towns then you might like to develop a single application and deploy it to each town in turn. This is the core invoation that I am reaching for here simply the "develop once deploy many times" approach.
