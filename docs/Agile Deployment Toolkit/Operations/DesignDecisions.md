### DEVELOPMENT MODE

In development mode, there are three machine types a "single webserver" and a "single database" server and a "build machine" upon which the server build process is initiated.  
Its possible for the build machine to be your own laptop if you are running some debian/ubuntu version of linux, but it is not recommended because it will make configuration changes to your machine.  
    
What you can do is run a **dedicated** "Ubuntu" or "Debian" Linux off a usb stick with persistent storage on your laptop to perform your builds on and have that USB as your "build usb", this would save you a bit of money because you won't need to be running a (small) build machine in the cloud all the time but it would mean that your build machine would have to be outside of the VPC of your server fleet.  
  
The webserver and the database share their configurations using the S3 object store of your cloudhost provider and you will find a set of wrapper scripts which interface to the S3 datastore in

>      ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/

on each machine type. 

Managed databases are not intended to be used in development mode, rather, use the custom installed database that is provisioned within the build process itself whilst you are in development mode.  
  
### PRODUCTION MODE

In production mode, there are four machine types: there is autoscaler machines, there is webserver machines, there is a database server and there's a build machine upon which the build is initiated. There can also be (should also be) a managed database running to which your webservers are directly connecting. Optionally there is a 5th type of machine called an "authentication server". 

The autoscaler machine monitors the webservers for responsiveness and is responsible for initiating (and performing) the build of new webservers according to [scaling criteria](../Deployment/AutoscalingConfiguration.md) (statically defined).  

The webservers have their ip addresses registered with a DNS system and load balancing between them performed using round robin built into the DNS system.  
The Database server is responsible for runnng the database system. The Database system can use DBaaS managed databases but our own "database machine" still needs to run in such a scenario as we depend on our own custom backups which our database machine generates.

### FIREWALLING  

The firewalling by default works as follows, there are two layers to the firewalling, the cloudhost's native firewall and the ufw/iptables firewall running on the machines themselves:  

All machines allow SSH connections from your build machine and between each other only.  
Only webservers and autoscalers can connect to the database port.  
If you are using a managed database only machines in your private network can connect to the managed DB if the DB is within the same VPC as your webservers or the specific ip addresses of your webservers/database machine is allowed through to the managed database explicitly if the DB is in a different VPC to the servers.  
If you are using Cloudflare, only Cloudflare ip addresses [Cloudflare IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ips/) can connect to your webservers. Direct connections are not allowed to your webserver, only connections through the "Cloudflare Proxy". If you are not using Cloudflare, then, connections to your webserver(s) on port 443 are allowed from anywhere. Cloudflare does provide some attractive features such as your being able to use "zero trust acccess control" to prevent direct access to anything that you don't explicitly allow. The authentication server solution that I provide allows you to firewall off port 443 entirely and grant selective access to to authenticated clients. 

### CONFIGURATION

To understand how the configuration system works you can review the scripts for webserver, autoscaler or database machine types. I needed some way to share configuration settings between machine types. The way I wanted to do this was to use the S3 Object Storage service from the current provider and I decided to code up wrappers for the s3cmd tool and explicitly write and retrieve the configuration settings that the servers were using from a shared S3 bucket or configuration datastore. In this way, machines can share their ip addresses and other configuration settings with each other in a defined way and from that firewall access and other necessities can be taken care of once a machine publishes its ip address to the configration system.

>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/CheckConfigDatastore.sh
>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/DeleteFromConfigDatastore.sh
>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/GetDBCredential.sh
>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/DeleteFromConfigDatastore.sh
>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/GetFromConfigDatastore.sh
>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/ListFromConfigDatastore.sh
>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/datastore/configwrapper/PutToConfigDatastore.sh

The configration bucket as a whole is cleaned out for each new build and so has to be reconstructed for the current build set up. Using this technique, is a useful way for sharing configuration settings without having to rely on the method of using tools such as "s3fs" to mount bucket and so on and create a shared filesystems etc.

In most cases you aren't going to want to touch anything in the S3 configuration bucket directly, an exception to this is the scaling mechanism. You will find a script

>     ${BUILD_HOME}/helperscripts/AdjustScaling.sh

on the build client machine which you can run to adjust the number of webservers being provisioned.

And on the autoscaler, there is a script:

>     ${HOME}/utilities/processing/ManuallyScale.sh <no_webservers>

### ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS  

On both the development mode and production mode temporal application backups can be made from the webservers and the database machines. 
Cron is used to schedule system processes on all machines and there is a defined process for [application development workflow](https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/master/doco/AgileToolkitDeployment/ApplicatonWorkflow.md) starting in development mode and working up towards full production deployments with multiple webservers.
Applications can be deployed from baselines or from temporal backups depending on your needs. Temporal backups should always be kept private to your organisation where as baselines can be made public if you wish to share your prebuilt customised bespoke appliction with other developers 

**VERY IMPORTANT: - with appropriate care taken not to have sensitive credentials in the codebase/SQL dump of the baselines you are making public**
