If you want to have a fully deployed application then the workflow will be as follows:

1. Deploy a virgin copy of your chosen CMS system and develop your application until you are happy with it.
2. Create baseline repositories of your application's webroot and database
3. Deploy the baselines you created in 2. using a domain name of your choice (you need to set

>     PERSIST_ASSETS_TO_DATASTORE=1
and 
>     DIRECTORIES_TO_MOUNT=\<directory name\>
if you want your assets to be persisted to the datastore automatically)
4. Make a temporal backup of your applications webroot and database (this will most likely be an HOURLY periodicity backup)
5. Make a full application deployment using the temporal backups created in 4.

NOTE: It may well be the case that another developer or even company performs steps 1 and 2 for you and that you use the baselines they have developed for your own usecase.
