There is are scripts "AgeOfConfigFile.sh" and "AgeOfDatastoreFile.sh".
As far as I know these work fine with the s3cmd and rclone commands when the datastore is in a different timezone from the servers themselves but will not work with s5cmd because I don't know of anyway using s5cmd to tell the timezone of the datastore and I didn't want to make specific customisations for that tool involving explicitly stating what the timezone of the datastore is. This means that objects are created in the datastore with a timestamp which is inconsistent with the timezone of the servers when the datastore is in a different timezone from the servers meaning that time based comparisons such as the age of a backup file in the datastore can't be relied on because if there is a 1 hr difference in timezone between the servers and the datastore then an object written the datastore 5 minutes ago might show up as having been written there 1 hr and 5 minutes ago when interrogated through one of these two scripts.
Therefore s5cmd is a suitable tool to use in all situations except if the timezone of your datastore is different to the timezone of your servers. In practice this should probably never be the case but if your cloudhost, for example, only provides object storage services in Amsterdam and you are in London then you would have a problem if you wanted to run your servers in London when there is an hour time difference with Amsterdam. So, your options would be, 1) run your servers in Amsterdam also, even though you are in London thus having your servers in the same timezone as your datastore 2) use rclone as your datastore tool and run your servers in London knowing that timestamping is taken care of 3) use s3cmd as your datastore tool and run your servers in London.
I think that those are reasonable solutions to this issue, but, of course if I don't know something simple about how to easily obtain the timezone of objects written using s5cmd without generating custom metadata which would then need to be processed in a bespoke way for one tool only, then I am all ears and will implement what you advise.
