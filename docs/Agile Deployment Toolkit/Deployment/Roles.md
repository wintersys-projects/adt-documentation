The vision for this toolkit is to have 5 different classes of user role.

1. **Toolkit developers/extenders** - these are people who either maintain or update the core of the ADT or fork their own version to extend for their particular needs.
2. **Toolkit deployers** - these are people who deploy websites using the toolkit but don't actively extend the toolkit. Typically the will deploy applications built by appication developers (next).
3. **Application developers** - these are people who develop applications through the toolkit such as Joomla applications or Wordpress applications and then provide a baseline of their customised application to 3rd party customers
4. **Application administrators** - these are users of the applications who are probably not involved in the application's deployment but that administer the applications using the application's backend this would classically be a wordpress or a joomla administrator, for example. 
5. **Application users** - these are regular end users who use the deployed applications wihout any special privileges. They can register to use your application and once they have done that, become and end user of it.
