On each of the servers is a file which contains all the live configuration settings for the toolkit. They are accessed very often by the scripts.

>     On the autoscaler it is called ${HOME}/runtime/autoscaler_configuration_settings.dat  
>     On the webserver it is called ${HOME}/runtime/webserver_configuration_settings.dat 
>     On the database it is called ${HOME}/runtime/database_configuration_settings.dat

The values of the variables in these files was set when you made the deployment. If you wanted to change one of these settings, say you wanted to update a PAT for github because it was about to expire you will can go to each of these files and make the update. 
You have to know what you are doing, but, I am just showing you here that it is possible to change the operation after deployment. You need to reference the [spec](https://github.com/wintersys-projects/adt-build-machine-scripts/blob/master/templatedconfigurations/specification.md) to find out what each variable in these files is for.
