**NOTE:** 

You can also use your cloudhost's backup service to make backups of your machines if you want super safe backups above and beyond what is provided here. 

##### BACKUP PERIODICITY  

The backup periodicity is as follows:

##### hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, bimonthly, shutdown, manual and all  

What this means is that backups of the webroot and your database will be automatically taken and initiated by cron at these different periodicities.

You can make a manual backup on from the build machine by runining the backup scripts from the build machine: 

>     ${BUILD_HOME}/helperscripts/PerformWebsiteBackup.sh 

>     ${BUILD_HOME}/helperscripts/PerformDatabaseBackup.sh  
 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### HOW TEMPORAL BACKUPS ARE MADE FROM CRON

The backups are created by calling the script

>     ${HOME}/cron/BackupFromCron.sh**

on the webserver machine  

and  

>     ${HOME}/cron/BackupFromCron.sh

on the database machine 

The cron script calls

>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/backupscripts/Backup.sh

on the webserver machine  

and  

>     ${HOME}/providerscripts/backupscripts/Backup.sh

on the database machine  

You passes in the build periodicity **"HOURLY", "DAILY", "WEEKLY", "MONTHLY", "BIMONTHLY", "SHUTDOWN" or "MANUAL"** and the **BUILD_IDENTIFIER** and that will then create a backup in your S3 datastore. The backup will be identifiable by BUILD_IDENTIFIER and periodicity in the datastore.

#####  IF THE ASSETS ARE STORED IN THE CLOUD AND THEN MOUNTED THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE BACKUPS (PERSIST_ASSETS_TO_CLOUD=1)
	
Its normal to set 

>     PERSIST_ASSETS_TO_CLOUD to 0

for baselines and virgin builds. This is because the cloud is only used to offload assets for a production build.  

So ordinarily if your application users are going to be generating assets you want them to be stored in your datastore and distributed from there (see elsewhere in this doco). Note, if your assets are stored in the cloud i.e. PERSIST_ASSETS_TO_CLOUD is set to 1, then, it is the only place where those assets are stored, there aren't any backups, so if you were to delete the assets from the bucket they are stored in by mistake, for example, it might hose your application. Therefore it is up to you to set up a backup policy for the assets that are stored in you S3 bucket. Its just a bucket with assets in it at the end of the day, so its not hard to make backups if you want to but some applications can generated GBs and GBs of assets and so can be hard to backup. Bottom line, be very cautious deleting image and media assets that are stored in S3 when PERSIST_ASSETS_TO_CLOUD is set to 1 because by default they are the only copy you have of those assets.
