For reference the VPC IP RANGES that I used for my sample deployments are shown below. 
The ranges that you need to set may vary depending on the region that you deploying to. 
You should check in the GUI system with your provider that you are using the correct range for your region.

>     Digital Ocean: export VPC_IP_RANGE="10.106.16.0/20"
>     Exoscale: export VPC_IP_RANGE="10.0.0.0/24"
>     Linode: export VPC_IP_RANGE="10.0.1.0/24"
>     Vultr: export VPC_IP_RANGE="10.8.96.0/20"
