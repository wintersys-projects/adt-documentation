The build process creates a very simple script called **/usr/bin/run**

There are various scripts you might want to run from the command line of your servers and you can do this easily using the run script.

For example, if you want to use the ConnectToRemoteMYSQLDB.sh script you can run it:

>     cd ${HOME}/providerscripts/utilities/remote
>     run ./ConnectToRemoteMYSQLDB.sh
