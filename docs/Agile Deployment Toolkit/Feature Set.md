**Here is an overview of the features offered by the Agile Deployment Toolkit**

* Fully automated virgin server configuration and deployment with sensible default webserver and database configuration settings with best practice security guidelines baked in.

* Flexible deployment options - number of webservers to be used for a deployment when in production mode with a single webserver development mode, for when you are developing your application.

* In built resilient and scalable architecture including flexible time based scaling to accommodate increased or decreased capacity

* Option to use "self managed" databases or to use managed as a service databases from a 3rd party (DBaaS)

* Moderate learning curve for usage

* Support for deployment to multiple cloud hosts. Currently, Digital Ocean, Exoscale, Linode and Vultr. If you develop a problem or issue with the cloud host you have deployed to, simply perform a frictionless redeploy to another of the supported VPS cloud host providers

* Easily choose the machine sizes that you want to deploy to, depending on what capacity you need

* Deploy to Ubuntu or Debian with extensibility of the scripts to other flavours of Linux taken into consideration

* Automated "double" backups

* Easy inbuilt SMTP configuration for your application

* Several supported application types - Joomla, Wordpress, Drupal, Moodle and with a little work, further application types can be added

* Built with general extensibility in mind so that scripts are easy to extend

* Free to use, free to extend

* Choice to use Cloudflare as your DNS service provider for increased security

* Easy command line access to your servers (no faff)

* Choice of webservers to use, NGINX, APACHE, LIGHTTPD

* Current support for PHP based applications, but, with potential to be extended to support other languages

* Ability to store application assets in Object Storage which saves disk capacity (and cost) on your server machines

* Choice of self managed databases to use, currently, MariaDB, MySQL or Postgres

* Status messages deliverable by email during system operation

The Agile Deployment Toolkit is designed to have a core of functionality, which can be thoroughly tested and well maintained, but, it is also designed to be extensible outside of the core so that it is flexible enough to support an arbitrary set of solutions as are required by the users of the toolkit.
