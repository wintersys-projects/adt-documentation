#### AVAILABLE PROJECTS

1. [Agile Deployment Toolkit](<Agile Deployment Toolkit/ADT.md>).

The Agile Deployment Toolkit was built as a volunteer without using money (other than the costs of running testing and development servers) and starting from nothing. This project had a budget of at most $30 a month and me existing like a scroungy sewer rat **living for code** to get it this far. The programming (Posix shell basically) wasn't all that difficult but what was extremely difficult was the integration challenenge in other words, finding solutions that would fit various providers on the shifting sands of what is relatively new technology. If this is to become established its going to need intense usage from other developers such that all possible integration quirks are erradicated and once that is made so, you might have a powertool on your hands for social network (and other application type) deployments "at scale".
