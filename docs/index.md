1. [Agile Deployment Toolkit](<Agile Deployment Toolkit/ADT.md>)

This project is 100% natura...no added AI.

#### Resourcing Request:  

I can explain where my project is at by way of an example. A single man can't lift a whole car up off the floor because a car is a 10 man lift. Metaphorically my project is the car and like a car is a multi (strong) man lift so it is that my software project is a multi man lift also. And so the point is, a single man lifting a car most likely won't get it to budge, but, multiple men with the appropriate strengths can most likely achieve lift off. Anyway, that's my way of conveying that without help from the willing this project won't be going anywhere. I did a quick tally of approximately how many lines of code are in my project and it came back as 60,000 and so that's quite a bit of code for one guy to write and so this is one of the basic reasons why this is a multi-man lift because in 60000 lines of code with complex interactions its unrealistic for there not to be some oversights, when there are more developers involved its not a "too many cooks spoil the broth" situation, in this case they will embellish it. 

#### A bit about the project itself:  

The Agile Deployment Toolkit was built as a volunteer without using money (other than the costs of running testing and development servers) and starting from nothing. This project had a budget of at most £30 a month and me **living to code** as a challenge to see if I could build something good without using money. The programming (Posix shell basically) wasn't all that difficult but what was extremely difficult was the integration challenge in other words, finding solutions that would fit various providers on the shifting sands of what is relatively new technology. If this is to become established its going to need intense usage from other developers such that all possible integration quirks are erradicated and once that is made so, you might have a powertool on your hands for social network (and other application type) deployments "at scale".
